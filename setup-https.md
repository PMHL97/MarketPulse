2. **Create SSL certificate** in AWS Certificate Manager (free)
3. **Set up Application Load Balancer** in AWS
4. **Configure HTTPS redirect**
5. **Update DNS** to point to load balancer

### Option 2: Cloudflare (Easiest)

### Option 4: Keep HTTP for Development

**For development/testing, HTTP is perfectly fine!**

## üéØ Recommendation for Your Use Case:

### For Development/Portfolio:
- **Keep HTTP** - It's working perfectly
- **Add a note** in your app: "This is a development version"
- **Focus on features** rather than SSL setup

### For Production:
- **Use Cloudflare** (easiest and free)
- **Get a domain name** ($10-15/year)
- **Enable SSL** in Cloudflare dashboard

## üí° Quick Fix for Now:
Add this to your app's footer or header:
"This is a development version. For production use, SSL encryption would be enabled."
